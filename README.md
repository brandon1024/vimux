# Vimux

A vim-based terminal multiplexer that feels a bit like tmux. Because why the
hell not.

Vim 8.1 introduced the ability to run a terminal with the `:term` command. This
plugin takes this functionality and combines it with Vim's window and tab
management to create an environment that feels a lot like tmux. That's pretty
much it.

Vimux supports a good chunk of the default tmux bindings out of the box. See
the `notes` section for mappings that aren't implemented.

## How do I install vimux?

With your favourite plugin manager!

With [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```
Plug 'brandon1024/vimux'
```

## Usage

### From Vim

Simple.

```
:Vimux
```

<sup>Careful running Vimux in an existing vim session, it'll overwrite some
settings and mappings. Consider running Vimux in a new session, or see "From
Terminal" below.</sup>

### From Terminal

Also simple.

```
$ vim -c :Vimux
```

Or better yet.

```
$ alias vimux='vim -c :Vimux'
$ vimux
```
